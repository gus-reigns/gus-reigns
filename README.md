- Hello everyone! My name is Gustavo Gonzalez, and I will be using this page to
keep up with old projects I've done through college, as well as any new ones that
I take on. 

- I am looking to expand my current knowledge in Computer Science! I like to learn about new languages and
find ways to use them. 

- I've used programming languages such as C++ and Java in the past. I am also familiar with HTML, PHP, Javascript,
XML, and SQL

- If you need to reach me for any reason, email me at gustavogonzalez.cs@gmail.com
